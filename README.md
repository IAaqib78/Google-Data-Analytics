<p align="center"><em>Smart device usage insights driving data-informed marketing decisions</em></p>









## **Introduction** 

Welcome to my portfolio-ready case study analyzing smart device usage for Bellabeat, a health-focused tech company that designs wellness products for women. This project was completed using RStudio and R Markdown, and follows the structured data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.

As a junior data analyst, I was tasked with uncovering insights from smart device usage data to help Bellabeat refine its marketing strategy and better understand consumer behavior. This case study simulates a real-world business scenario and demonstrates my ability to work with data, communicate findings, and generate actionable recommendations.

## **Scenario**

Bellabeat is a growing company in the global smart wellness market. Cofounder and Chief Creative Officer Ur≈°ka Sr≈°en believes that analyzing fitness tracker data can unlock new growth opportunities. I was asked to focus on one Bellabeat product and analyze user behavior using publicly available Fitbit data.

**The goal:**     identify trends in smart device usage and translate those insights into strategic marketing recommendations for Bellabeat.

## **Business Task**

Analyze smart device usage data to answer the following questions:

What are the key trends in smart device usage?

How can these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?

How can these insights inform Bellabeat‚Äôs marketing strategy?

**Data Sources**

Fitbit Fitness Tracker Dataset (CC0: Public Domain via Kaggle) This dataset includes minute-level activity, sleep, and heart rate data from 30 consenting Fitbit users. It provides a rich foundation to explore daily habits and wellness patterns.

## **Data Preparation**

Imported and explored multiple CSV files using readr and dplyr

Cleaned and merged datasets using distinct(), drop_na(), and inner_join()

Verified data integrity and structure (wide vs. long format)

Assessed credibility using the ROCCC framework (Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, Cited)


**Analysis & Visualization**

Using ggplot2, I created visualizations to explore relationships between:

Steps taken and calories burned

Sleep duration and activity levels

Daily intensity and user engagement

I also calculated summary statistics to identify average behaviors and usage patterns.


---


















## **Key Findings**

Users who took more steps consistently burned more calories

Sleep duration varied widely, but longer sleep correlated with lower activity levels

Most users were moderately active, suggesting potential for targeted engagement strategies


## **Recommendations**


Based on the analysis, I proposed the following high-level marketing strategies:

Promote Bellabeat‚Äôs Time wellness watch to users focused on activity tracking

Emphasize hydration and mindfulness features in the Spring bottle and app

Use personalized insights to drive engagement through Bellabeat‚Äôs membership program


## **Tools Used**

RStudio

R Markdown

Tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, readr)

janitor for cleaning column names

GitHub for version control and sharing
